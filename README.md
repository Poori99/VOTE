# VOTE: Blockchain-Based Voting System 🗳️
VOTE is a secure and transparent blockchain-based voting system that empowers users to participate in elections with confidence. 

## Project Background 📚
VOTE was created as a learning project during our first year under the Information Systems Management subject. 
It aims to showcase the potential of blockchain technology in revolutionizing the electoral process.

This project was originally inspired by the BlockVote project.


## Technology Stack 🎨
1. [BootStrap](https://getbootstrap.com/)
2. [Truffle](https://www.trufflesuite.com/) is a development framework for Ethereum that simplifies the process of building and deploying smart contracts. It provides tools for testing, deployment, and interaction with the blockchain.
3. [Ganache](https://www.trufflesuite.com/ganache) is a local Ethereum blockchain emulator that allows developers to test their smart contracts and applications in a controlled and private environment. It's an essential tool for Ethereum development.

## How to Use VOTE 🎉

> Make Sure that you have Truffle and Ganache installed.

1. Clone the repo
2. Navigate to the folder: `cd VOTE`
3. Install dependencies: `npm install`
4. Run the server: `npm run dev`

## Project Description 📚
VOTE is designed to address the challenges associated with traditional election systems by leveraging the power of blockchain technology. Key features and benefits of VOTE include:

- **Security**: VOTE ensures the integrity of the voting process by recording votes on a tamper-resistant blockchain, making it extremely difficult for any unauthorized party to manipulate the results.

- **Transparency**: The blockchain ledger is publicly accessible, allowing anyone to independently verify the election results. This transparency enhances trust in the electoral process.

- **Accessibility**: VOTE enables remote and secure voting, making it easier for voters to participate without the need to physically visit polling stations.

- **Immutable Records**: Once a vote is recorded on the blockchain, it cannot be altered or deleted, providing an irrefutable record of the election.

- **Open Source**: VOTE is an open-source project, which means that it can be audited and improved by the community to further enhance its security and functionality.
